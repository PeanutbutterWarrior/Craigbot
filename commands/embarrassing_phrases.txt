Home Depot:tm: was the best thing that happened ever since the day I met power tools!
That first time going into Home Depot:tm: seeing the great supply of tools and materials - I almost pissed myself on the spot!
I was a lost cause until I heard about Home Depot:tm:'s BOGO free deal. It even cured my social security!
Even my mom enjoys shopping at Home Depot:tm:!
I was walking down the aisle of ever affordable power tools and DIY materials when I met your mother. She was looking at a Strongman's Strong Power Hammer, I shan't tell you which.
The smell of Home Depot:tm: always gets me going.
*blushes* oh Home Depot:tm:-chan *notices your great deals on power tools, construction materials, and premium services*

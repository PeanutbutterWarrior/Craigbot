Being happy is not something that you can just say "happy now" and be happy, you first have to give up.
It's ok to be gay, but it's not ok to be a gay furry.
Don't push while you're in the bathroom, you'll blow a gasket.
Get off discord and go do something productive with your spare time
If you get insulted say no u and if that doesn't work pull out the uno reverse card
If you're poor be rich
If your about to die, don't die
Lol stands for Lots Of Love
Eat enough beetroots and your poop will become pink
If you eat enough carrots you turn orange
run
If you're homeless just get a house.
It's never too early to give up, just too late.
